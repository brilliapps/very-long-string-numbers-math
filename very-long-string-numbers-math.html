   This is crude version of functions performing basic math operations: adding, substracting, multiplying and dividing
   The point is to perform any math operations using little chars from the numbers suppying functions.
   This functions is a starting point for LEARNING, improvements optimisations.
   An example of optimisation can be using more numbers/chars per partial operations using 
   full capacity of standard integer numbers in javascript or going even further using built in modern browsers Bigint numbers 
   At this stage i think it can be easier to port it to other languages, so using Bigint numbers in this edition would be confusing 
   Is tested enough yet not tested even much more extensively (actually before releasing i focused on dividing numbers which incorporates in multipying, adding, and substracting operations)
   And of course - for sure there are better resources to learn from than this 
  
   you can use numbers less than 0
   of course first number is divided by the second. The third parameter (default=2) is the max number after the dot (decimal part), and that last number after dot is returned rounded
   starting with one of the worst basic math operations to implement:
  <script>


  alert(idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('86379.3847', '39599', 12))
  
  </script>
  
    about half a minute to count 140 digits
  console.log('mt: '+idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('72542457482534938.92923719478', '9393531.639599', 140))  
  console.log('mt: '+idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('72542457482534938.92923719478', '-9393531.639599', 140))  
  
   even more interesting example - it may take f.e. about one minute to do the math:
  console.log('mt: '+idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('972561416387155160324342457482534938929237194785736365853788274081329385902999935', '99393531639599', 110))  
  some other examples
  console.log('mt: '+idm_multiply_large_textual_numbers('0.555', '0.55'))
  console.log('mt: '+idm_substract_large_textual_numbers('555', '560'))
  idm_add_large_textual_numbers('-55.5', '-5.5')
  console.log('mt: '+idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('126', '630'))
  console.log('mt: '+idm_divide_large_textual_numbers('126', '6300'))
  
   And finally - why i decided to do this code? As far as i know there is one important restriction when using
   different libraries in the interent. The most important for me is the maximum digits you can use as input and the output has similar limitations.
   Here it works pretty slow, but you don't have any digit number limits, just inform as third parameter the max digit number you expect
   I decided to do this because i thought it would be much easier than it was
  
   Please, feel free to inform me of any bugs giving the type of math operation and the numbers/params used for it. 
   Thank you.
